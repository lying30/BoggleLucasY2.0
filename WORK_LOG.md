| Jan 7 |    2-3pm    |       I reloaded my repo with the corrected tester files and then started to code a little bit based on what we talked about in class about recursive DFS. |
| Jan 8 | 10:30-11:55 | Established the methods I think i might use and implemented a trie for the words and began to implement the DFS method explore like we went over in class. |
